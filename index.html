      I make quiet interfaces for loud systems. I'm hands-on across the stack
      — leading small teams, designing for humans, writing code and copy,
      shaping architecture, and shipping software across mobile, desktop, and
      web. I've been doing this for 30 years.

      This approach lately carried me into electric hydrofoiling boats: fast,
      physical, connected machines that quite literally leave the water.
      Flying boats demand intuitive interfaces and deep visibility into what
      the boat and the fleet are doing. This work happened at
      <a href="https://candela.com">Candela</a>.

      Earlier work took me through health tech, fintech, education, and games
      for kids. Different contexts, same problem: make something powerful and
      complex feel simple and human.

      I'm now picking the next problem. If you think we should talk, I'd love
      to hear from you.
